QC of DCIS data

The following files are necessary for the QC -- 1) SamplesTable.csv, and 2) rectified_1.csv
The first file is the original sample annotation file, an the second one is a "rectified" sample annotation. 

R code and result table is posted here but the text files are not provided. The code will be progressively updated.
