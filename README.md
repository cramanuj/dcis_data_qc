QC of DCIS data

The following files are necessary for the QC -- 1) CountTable_withoutDups.csv, 2) SamplesTable.csv, and 3) rectified_1.csv
The first file is the raw RNAseq count table, the second file includes the original sample annotation file, an the last file is a "rectified" sample annotation. 

Embedded R code and qc results are posted here along with a document but, the text files are not provided. The document will be progressively updated.
